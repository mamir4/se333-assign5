Part 1:
Created tests for BarnesAndNoble where I tested:
- Specification Based Testing:
  - testing for when order passed in was null
  - when the required book was retrievable
  - when the required book was not retrievable
- Structural Based Testing:
  - There was overlap between Spec based and this so I tested for verifying methods like 
findByISBN and buyBook

Part 2:

Part 3:
All tests were generated.

Final comments: workflow passed, Jacoco report and Checkstyle were generated. The checkstyle is in .xml form, I am not sure if that needed to be made differently.
